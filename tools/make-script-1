# Page partitioning:
make PARSERFLAGS="-xc -xa -ecl -mix 1" >& mix=1.out

# Note, we leave the "-epn" netlist emission option for later,
#   since at this point, the operator is an instance with a mangled name

# To check the maximum #streams per page:  (must be <64)
#   csh ../../Tools/make-gplot-streams-max.cmd
#   cat results-streams-max.gplot

# To recover post-partitioned TDF:
#   (1) edit mix=1.out
#   (2) crop to keep only the post-partition TDF code (after "RESULTS")
#   (3) modify the top-level operator name back to its base form (no scoretmp)
#   (4) save as mix=1.out.tdf

# Continued in make-script-2
