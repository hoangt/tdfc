This directory is for characterizing SCORE applications
on VirtexII using tdfc 1.158 / 1.159.

To build, do the following:

(1) Create application subdirectories, and list their names in "APPS"
      e.g. from CVS:  cvs co `cat APPS`

(2) Copy "EXAMPLE-make-synplify" into each application subdirectory
      and edit the variables "tdfxcsrcs" "tdfsrcs" to list TDF sources

(3) source DOIT-APPS  (to build)
      Note, the default build uses Sun Grid Engine to parallelize
      Synplify tasks 6x and Xilinx ISE tasks 40x (for CalTech IC cluster).
      To build locally, edit or invoke BUILD-Makefile with:  PREFIX=

(4) source DOIT2-APPS  (to verify)

(5) if step (4) reveals an incomplete or erroneous build, then:
      - Repeat Synplify and Xilinx build:  ./BUILD-APPS
      - Repeat verification step (4)
      - Rebuild Excel reports:
          ./BUILD-APPS cleanreport
          ./BUILD-APPS synreport xilreport
