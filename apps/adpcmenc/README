This directory contains a SCORE implementation of the
UCLA Mediabench Intel/DVI ADPCM encoder.

The data-flow decomposition is adapted from the CS262 SCORE project,
11/1998.  Recoded in TDF by Eylon Caspi, 4/2000.

The encoder converts 16-bit signed integers from stdin
into byte-packed nibble codewords on stdout.

The file "clinton.pcm" (originally provided with MediaBench)
should be used as input.  For testing, run as:

adpcmenc-main <clinton.pcm >/dev/null
