ADPCM Encoder hand-clustering
-----------------------------

- This directory contains versions of the ADPCM encoder,
    hand-clustered for efficient execution on small physical resources
- Modify AdpcmEnc_instance.cc with new "page_group" values

8cp	Fully-spatial


7cp	DFG loops are completely in hardware

	0: DiffSign, DivMul2, DivMul1, DivMul0, ValPredUpdate,
	   IndexOffsetTable, (StepTable), copy_unsigned_3
	1: MuxNibbles


5cp	DFG loops are partially in hardware; 2 time-slices per sample

	0: DiffSign, DivMul2, DivMul1, DivMul0, ValPredUpdate
	1: IndexOffsetTable, (StepTable), copy_unsigned_3, MuxNibbles

	(requires 8 CMBs due to fanout from DivMul in cluster 0
	 to MuxNibbles and IndexOffsetTable in cluster 1;
	 could be shrunk to 5 CMBs by making MuxNibbles feed IndexOffsetTable)


3cp	DFG loops are partially in hardware; 3 time-slices per sample
