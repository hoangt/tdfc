You will attached the interpolation filter and the complete pipeline.
Normally, there is everything (TDF, driver, Makefiles, .fuser, input image).
Ask me if you  are missing something. The commands are:
- for interpolation : runapp <input image.pgm>
- for assembly (pipeline): ve5_SCORE <input image.pgm> <output image.pbm>

Thanks for your support.
