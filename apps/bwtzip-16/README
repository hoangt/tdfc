Subject: SCORE Problem

Hi,

I tried to test my parallelized compression program, but SCORE failed with
an error message that I've never seen before.  I didn't expect that there
would be any problems while parallelizing this...

My application is located here:
http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~stl/bwtzip-16/

twain.txt is the file it's supposed to be run on; twain.bwt-1 is the output
it should produce.  The application is compiled with "make" and run with
"myapp twain.txt name_of_output_file"

The error message I get is:

[09/23/2003 Tue 04:49.33 AM stl@matrix11@CS ~/work/bwtzip-16]
> myapp twain.txt twain.bwt-16
ERROR: No available entry available in dataPtrTable: No such file or
directory
       due to implementation limitation: Illegal seek

Is this happening because this application uses a /lot/ of streams and
segments?

Thanks,
Stephan
