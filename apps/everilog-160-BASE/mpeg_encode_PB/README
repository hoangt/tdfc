Before making the executable (score_mpeg), you need to determine how
many pictures you would like to encode (including the first I frame).

Then, you edit the topAll.fuser file:

topAll(5,101376,352,,,,,,,,,,,,);

Changing the first parameter to the number of pictures you want to 
encode.

Then after making, then you have to start up the Runtime (of course),
then run score_mpeg with the argument of how many pictures you want to
encode, i.e.:

score_mpeg 5
