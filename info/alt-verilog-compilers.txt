 	I tried using Xilinx XST as suggested above,
 	but it did not help.  For one thing, the XST documentation
 	says that it will only retime registers that are inferred
 	(behavioral), not ones that are instantiated (structural).
 	So my idea of XST retiming structural Verilog from Synplify
 	is not supposed to work.  I do not know whether this is a
 	"feature" that can be turned off (no mention in the docs)
 	or a bona fide limitation of the software.  So I tried it.
 	Unfortunately, XST complains about instantiated modules
 	not having the "INIT" parameter used in the Synplify Verilog.
 	I am not sure why this is so, except perhaps that the Synplify
 	and XST module libraries are incompatible -- Synplify's has
 	"INIT", XST's does not.  e.g.:

ERROR:HDLCompilers:200 - ../../page_fllm_d1_ScOrEtMp326.v line 45683 Target of d efparam 'G_18_0_axb_0_cZ.INIT' does not exist

 	I also tried doing complete behavioral synthesis in XST,
 	specifically for the MPEG forward DCT (fllm).  Unfortunately,
 	XST could not retime it to be faster than 50MHz, which is
 	no better than Synplify.  In fact, Synplify 7.1 worked on
 	one of two DCTs, whereas XST worked on neither.  I tried
 	some compiler directives/attributes, like "pipelined
 	multipliers," to no avail.

 	XST appears to be a dud.

 	BWRC supposedly has Synopsis Design Compiler,
 	whose FPGA edition might be useful for retiming.
 	However, I presently cannot log into my BWRC account
 	to try it or get documentation (synopsis.com does not
 	make manuals freely available online... I need the "site ID"
 	from the locally installed files).  I don't suppose you know
 	whether Design Compiler can retime structural netlists?

 	Aside from XST and Synopsis DC, I don't see much choice
 	besides waiting for Synplify version 8.  I guess I should
 	send Synplicity as many test cases as they can stomach.

 	Talk to you soon,
 	- Eylon.
