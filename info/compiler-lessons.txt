Suggestions for Writing a Compiler:
Lessons Learned from tdfc
-----------------------------------

Eylon Caspi, 2005


- Guard all warnings with "-d" debug flag

- Guard all warnings with "-dN" debug flag, debug level N, warn(msg,n)

- Warnings should report token horizontal position

- Is linking really necessary?
    * Linking in tdfc == threading names to targets
        (e.g. call to called op), done after parsing
    * Do manual linking during parsing,
      e.g. link parameterized return stream width after parsing op decl
    * Do manual linking when transforming AST

- Folding should be an AST method, descend all the way into types

- Parameter passing should distinguish between
    input (by value), output (by value), input/output (by val/ret, esp arrays)

- To guarantee analyses have been done and have not been outdated
    by tree modification,
    * Mark trees (tree tops) with analysis done flags
    * Let analyses skip work if   analysis done flag is set
    * Tree modification fns need hook to selectively erase analysis done flags

- Type Checking
    * When to emit type-checking width warnings?  (creates duplicates)
    * Separate type creation/completion/linking from type checking
