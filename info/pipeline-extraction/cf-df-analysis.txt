CONTROL FLOW + DATA FLOW ANALYSES

Stmt / BB has:
  - CFGI    set of predecessor stmts  (CFG in edges)
  - CFGO    set of successor   stmts  (CFG out edges)  (only if has > 1)
  - VD      set of variables defined by stmt
  - VU      set of variables used    by stmt
  - LI, LO  set of variables live on entry, on exit
  - RD      set of reaching defs  (defs from CFGI paths)
  - RU      set of reached  uses  (uses by   CFGO paths)
  - AE      set of available exprs  (exprs computed before entry; useful?)
  - DFG     data flow DAG annotated with
              * PI  nodes for externally defined, used vars (subset of RD)
              * PO  nodes for locally defined vars (subset of RU + dead defs)
              * DFI nodes = def-use chain inputs  == PI
              * DFO nodes = def-use chain outputs == PO intersect RU

A def-use edge from Stmt s1 to s2 is converted to a stream by:
  * s1 --> { s1, emit def }
  * s2 --> { consume use, s2 }

A def-use edge s1->s2 may be converted to a stream only if
  each execution of s1 implies a corresponding execution of s2
  before any subsequent execution of s2.
Necessary but not sufficient condition:
  (s1 dominates s2) AND (s2 reverse-dominates s1)
  does not account for s1 looping or s2 looping (maybe split s1, s2)
