Subject: PAR with floating interconnect regs  (+ file)

[ this time with attachment ]


John,

I recompiled some of the SCORE apps, as we discussed on Monday,
with constraints to make sure that interconnect pipelining
registers did not pack with logic.  This was as attempt to
get a greater speedup from stream-based interconnect pipelining.

I tried 2 variants:

   (1) Each register gets a complete slice, and

   (2) Each pair of registers get a slice
       (pack data pipelining regs d[0]+d[1], d[2]+d[3], etc.)

An Excel results file is included.

The short answer is that this only helps MPEG, not the other apps.
Also, in all cases (including MPEG), a full-chip PAR without the
slice packing constraints is still faster than an area-constrained
PAR (+20% area expansion) with the slice packing constraints.

So it appears that expanding the allowable PAR area is the only
reliable way to improve interconnect timing.  Adding interconnect
pipelining registers to the RTL is not sufficient so long as
area is constrained.
