Eylon,

    Stephan has a case where he matches eos in the signature,
writes a final (special) word to a stream and then calls done().

    He is apparently losing that final word in many cases.

    I looked at the instance code generated and noted that there's a possiblity
that the this could happen if the output stream is full.  The explicit/user
state
cases are all guarded with &&!STREAM_FULL(...), but the extra, default
EOS case is not so guarded.   So, I think it's possible to skip the user's
EOS statecase and run the default one instead.
    Fix for that is, I believe, obvious (just add STREAMFULL to the default
case).   ...since I haven't touched tdfc in a while I'll leave that to you.

    However, simply fixing this (by editing the generated code) was not enough
to make Stephan's problem go away, so there may be another problem lurking
somewhere behind here.

                                            Andre'
