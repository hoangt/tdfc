4 Page Partitioning modes:

(1) no partitioning (single page)

     * flatten
     * treat top composition as page


(2) "-pp1" op per page
       [ Extracted pipelines get own page ]

     * flatten
     * wrap ops in compositions
     * Verilog emit 2nd level

(3) "-pp" automatic partitioning

     * flatten
     * compute partitions
     * wrap partitions in compositions
     * Verilog emit 2nd level

(4) "-ppm" manual page partitioning
        [ Extracted pipelines remain in original partition ]

     * flatten
     * wrap orig. partitions in compositions
          (problem: associating extracted pipelines)
     * Verilog emit 2nd level
     
     or
     
     * flatten all but top level composition
          (problem: buried segments)
     * Verilog emit 2nd level
