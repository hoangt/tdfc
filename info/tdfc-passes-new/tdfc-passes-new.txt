TDFC PASSES
-----------

- Load files

    * Pre-process

    * Parse

    * Link

    * Type check

	(semantically correct; symbols linked;
	 no nodes shared (except any/none)

- Canonical Form

    * Lift in-lines to stmt level
	(in-line calls + memory refs appear as stmts using temps)
    
    * Basic blocks
	(state actions are single block, straight-line code,
	 with if/goto at end; if branches contain goto only)
    
    * Exline
        (no in-line calls or memory refs)
    
    * Dismantle shared reg/stream access (for partitioning)
        (every original reg+stream is accessed in 1 state,
         or else in a collection states containing only that access)

    * Infer fanout ops
        (compositional streams have single reader)
        
    * instantiate fanout ops
        (no "copy" ops, turned into TDF code)

    * Instantiate bit-wise fanin ops  [not implemented]
	(no bit-level rewiring in composition operators)

- Synthesize

    * Flatten / unique
        (one compositional op composing behavioral + segment leaves)

    * Coagulation???
    
    * Bind Values
        (no parameters)
    
    * Single consumption
        (no multiple consumption in state input)
    
    * Schedule
        (each state action feasible in 1 cycle)

    * Page Partitioning
        (limit page size)

- Emit Target

    * Emit target language (ccinstance, TDF, Verilog, etc.)
