Modelling queue as DFPN process			Eylon Caspi
-------------------------------			2/10/04


Queue = (S_id x S_is -> S_od x S_os)
where _i is associated with an input  stream
      _o is associated with an output stream
       d = data,  b = backpressure,  s = state

R = { r1 : (*,*)             (i.e. consume)
      r2 : (\bot,non-empty)  (i.e. produce)
    }

NOT sufficient.
Production should depend on output stream back-pressure.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Consider DFPN that models explicit handshaking:
  [] ---d--> []
  [] <--b--- []
Forward data subsumes forward valid (and EOS)
Backwards back-pressure indicates a REQUEST for data

Demand driven:  producer's rule for data production consumes bp first
Data   driven:  consumer's rule for bp   production consumes d  first

Queue = (S_id x S_ob x S_is --> S_od x S_ib x S_os)
where _i is associated with an input  stream
      _o is associated with an output stream
       d = data,  b = backpressure,  s = state

R = { r1 : (*,\bot,[!full])  :-> (\bot,0,[depth+1])     (i.e. consume)
      r2 : (\bot,0,[!empty]) :-> (data,\bot,[depth-1])  (i.e. produce)
    }

These 2 rules model consumption and production as not only decoupled,
but happening separately (i.e. as serial transformations on state).

To model simultaneous consumption and production,
without data feed-through (i.e. produce data consumed previously), add:

      r3 : (*,0,[!empty]) :-> (data,0,[depth])  (i.e. consume + produce)

Queue input  is data driven
Queue output is demand driven
